# ## Specifying the optimization parameters
#
# The set of parameters to optimize are specified with a PyMC3 prior. This allows a great deal of flexibility, in particular the possibilities to transform the model variables to a more numerically advantageous space, and to provide complex prior distributions to help regularize training. By “PyMC3 prior”, we mean a PyMC3 model with no observed variables; see [Priors](priors).
#
# Parameters provided to an optimizer must correspond to the [_optimization space_](prior-types-and-spaces) (as opposed to the _model space_). The provided `OptimParams` allows to indicate this semantically, but it is up to you to provide the correct parameters.
#
# :::{Note}
# To avoid priors being over weighted, they are scaled by $\frac{K_b}{K}$, where $K_b$ is the length of a batch and $K$ is the total number of data points in a segments.

# ## Definition: `OptimizerStatus`
#
# Optimizers may involve several sub optimization problems, most notably optimization of the parameters and the latents. Storing their state as a bit flag allows to represent any convergence state; each bit corresponds to one subproblem, and is switched to 1 when that subproblem has converged. When all bits are 1, the optimizer has converged fully.
#
# The special value -1 is used to indicate a failure which causes termination of the optimization.
#
# | Status flag | Name | Meaning |
# |------------:|------|---------|
# |  00         | `NotConverged` | Nothing has converged |
# |  01         | `ParamsConverged` | Parameter optimization has converged |
# |  10         | `LatentsConverged` | Latents optimization has converged |
# |  11         | `Converged` | Fully converged |
# | -1 = …1111  | `Failed` | Failed |
#
# Updating the convergence status is done by *bitwise OR* operations. For example, to indicate that the optimization of parameters has converged, one does
#
#     status |= OptimizerStatus.ParamsConverged
#
# Repeating a bitwise or with the same argument does not further change the value of `status`.
# Furthermore, the `Failed` status cannot be changed by bitwise OR operations. Thus it is always safe to update the status as above, independent of its current value.
#
# To check for convergence, use the *bitwise AND*. For example, the following will skip an optimization step if `status` is `Failed` or `Converged`:
#
#     if not (status & OptimizerStatus.Converged) is OptimizerStatus.Converged:
#         # do optimize step
#
# For single-bit values, the identity comparison can be dropped:
#
#     if not (status & OptimizerStatus.ParamsConverged):
#         # do optimize step
#
# The `status` variable is checked by `step()` to skip updates for already converged sub-problems. Thus it can be used as a signal to terminate a fit. Since it is a public attribute, it's value can also be checked to determine whether to call `step()` at all.

    Base class for optimizers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: sinn.Model
    rng: Numpy Generator; i.e. RNG created with np.random.default_rng() or equivalent.
    data_segments:
        At the beginning of each pass, this iterator is moved one step ahead to draw
        a new data segment on which to compute gradients.
        Typically this would be an infinite generator, and each value a xarray.Dataset,
        with variable names (DataArrays) matching the names of observed histories.
        Any Mapping will work though, so values can also be a plain dictionary of
        {history name: ndarray} pairs.

        .. remark:: For convenience in test code, `data_segments` accepts
           arbitrary iterables. However these are not serializable, so when possible
           use `SegmentSampler` objects.
        observed_hists: List of observed histories.
        Observed histories are expected to be filled by data rather than integrated.
    latent_hists: List of latent histories.
        Latent histories have a random dependency but cannot be directly inferred
        from observations.
        Although they can be specified as both History instances or string names,
        strings are preferred, since they also work with histories in submodels.
        The following applies to both `observed_hists` and `latent_hists`:
           If there is only one history, it need not be wrapped with a list.
           Histories can be specified as strings, in which case the corresponding
           attribute is retrieved from `model`.
    fit_hyperparams: ParameterSet
        Must minimally define:
            'params':  Hyperparameters for the parameter optimizer
            'latents': Hyperparameters for the latents optimizer
            'Tθb': Parameter batch length, in time units
            'Tθr': Parameter relaxation time, in time units
            'Nθb': Number of batches per pass for the parameter fit
            'Tηb': Latents batch length, in time units
            'Tηr': Latents relaxation time, in time units
            'Nηb': Number of batches per pass for the latents fit
        The values of `params` and `latents` will be converted to shared
        variables when we call `compile_optimization_functions`.
    update_hyperparams: Callable, (SGDOptimizer) -> dict (Optional)
        This callback hook is to allow changing the hyperparams during a fit.
        It is called at the beginning of each pass.
        The optimizer object is passed as first argument; the function can
        access current estimates of the latents with the `.latent_hists`
        attribute, and hyperparameters with `.fit_hyperparams` and `.orig_fit_hyperparams`.
        (Recall that `.fit_hyperparams` contains shared variables.)
        The return value should be a dictionary of updates to apply to `fit_hyperparams`.
        These updated values should not be shared variables (they are applied
        with `.set_value()`).
