# Checking correctness of implementations

- **[Check that the optimized likelihood matches the simulator's p.d.f.](./One-step-forward%20cost)**
- **[Check correctness of simulators by comparing to stationary stats](./Check%20stationary%20stats)**
- [Inspect gradients for the latent variable at different points of the fit](./Inspect_gradients)
- [Inspect and plot marginals of the log likelihood](./Inspect_logL)
