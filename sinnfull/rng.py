# # Managing random numbers
#
# In order to perform reproducible inference experiments, we need reproducible random numbers. Moreover, we want these numbers to be high-quality: two numbers in the sequence should be as statistically independent as possible.
#
# The usual recommended way to do this is to seed one global random number generator (RNG) with a fixed value and use that for all random numbers. To see why this is not ideal, consider the typical situation where we have a stochastic model $\mathcal{M}_θ$ which depends on some noise input $ξ$, and a fitting algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ which requires an initial guess for the parameters $θ$. We want to test the algorithm for both different initial parameters $θ$ and different noise realizations $ξ$. The most convenient way to specify both, without introducing a bias (e.g. towards integer or repeated parameter values), is specify them as seeds, which an RNG can convert to the appropriate shape. However, changing the seed of $ξ$ should not change the values drawn for $θ$, and vice-versa. We _could_ simply define an RNGs for each seed, but these would have no guarantee of being independent – especially if low-entropy seeds are used, e.g. 0, 1, 2… What we want then is the following:
#
# - To convert low-entropy keys into high-quality RNG seeds;
# - To generator multiple independent and (very probably) non-overlapping RNGs from different seeds;
# - To make it simple to define different sequences of seeds for different purposes (e.g. initializing $θ$ vs generating $ξ$).
#
# Our approach is the following:
#
# - Rather than _integers_ as RNG _seeds_, we use _tuples_ as RNG _keys_.
# - RNG keys are of the form _(purpose, seed)_, where both _purpose_ and _seed_ are integers. For example, the _purpose_ integers for $θ$ and $ξ$ might respectively be 0 and 1. RNG keys for $θ$ would then have the form `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0,2)`…; those for $ξ$ would be similar, but starting with `1` instead of `0`.
# - A single high entropy value (`entropy`) is mixed with each key to create high-quality RNG seeds.
# - Those seeds are used to create independent RNGs.
#
# Moreover, to avoid accidentally breaking statistical independence, by default we prevent the same key from being used twice. In some cases this might actually be desired (e.g. to recreate earlier data), so a flag is provided to disable this check.
#
# Most of the heavy lifting here is done by `np.random.SeedSequence`, namely the conversion of low-entropy key tuples and the `entropy` value into high quality seeds for non-overlapping RNGs. This module adds:
#
# - A hard-coded `entropy` variable, which should be changed for each project.
# - Convenience functions `get_np_rng` and `get_shim_rng`, which take a key tuple and return an RNG.
#   + `get_np_rng` always returns a NumPy Generator object. Use `get_shim_rng` for an RNG that can be used in Theano expressions.
# - Verification (unless disabled) that each RNG key is used only once.
# - The function `draw_model_sample` to draw a reproducible sample from a PyMC3 model by providing an RNG key tuple.

    .. Important:: To ensure reproducibility, RNGs used within a task must not
       be used anywhere else (neither within another task, nor in module-level

       You can disable this check by passing the argument ``exists_ok=True``.
