# ## Models
#
# A small specialization of `~sinn.Model`, which adds support for defining _stationary statistics_.
#
# Subclasses should _define_ the following methods, if expressions for stationary statistics are available:
#
# - `_stationary_stats`
# - `stationary_dist`
#
# Subclasses should _use_ the following methods to access stationary statistics:
#
# - `stationary_stats` -> `sinn.models.ModelParams` (namespace of symbolic vars)
# - `stationary_stats_eval` -> `dict` (dict of real values)
# - `stationary_dist` -> `pymc3.Model`
#
# These latter methods take care of generic type casting, so that one only needs to implement the equations themselves in `_stationary_stats`. See the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck](./OU/OU) model for an example.

# (priors)=
# ## Priors
#
# _Priors_ are defined as [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) models. This allows us to
#
# - Define priors by simply naming distributions and setting their parameters.
#   PyMC3 combines all priors and constructions one log likelihood function for the whole prior.
# - Let PyMC3 use its default transformations to [_unbounded domains_](https://docs.pymc.io/pymc-examples/examples/pymc3_howto/api_quickstart.html#Automatic-transforms-of-bounded-RVs) for better numerical stability.
# - Define certain parameters as deriving from others using [`Deterministics`](https://docs.pymc.io/pymc-examples/examples/pymc3_howto/api_quickstart.html#Deterministic-transforms).
# - Make certain parameters [`Constant`](https://docs.pymc.io/api/distributions/discrete.html#pymc3.distributions.discrete.Constant).
#   This is a simple and effective way of masking a variable from optimization.[^1]
#
# Since priors generally depend on some parameters (like the dimension of input space), the objects in the `priors` collection are in fact *factory functions* (which return PyMC3 models).
# This also avoid creating a bunch of unneeded PyMC3 models just by importing the modules.
#
# [^1]: For more complex masks (e.g. only a subset of components in a connectivity matrix), one should be able to define the unmasked components as a lower-dimensional variable and then construct the full variable with concatenation and reshaping operations. However this has not been tested.
#
# :::{note}
# Since `Prior` instances are meant to represent model priors, they must not define [observed](https://docs.pymc.io/pymc-examples/examples/pymc3_howto/api_quickstart.html#Observed-Random-Variables) variables.
# :::
#
# :::{important}
# Prior variables are mapped model parameters based on their name. So if your model defines a parameter “alpha”, your prior _must_ define a variable named “alpha”. It can, however, by defined as constant or via a deterministic transformation of other variables.

#
# Random variables (RVs) in a prior can be of four[^num-RVs] PyMC3 types: `Constant`, `FreeRV`, `TransformedRV` or `Deterministic`, with each `TransformedRV` is associated to a `FreeRV` via a bijection.
#
# Optimization space
# ~ contains instances of `FreeRV`.
# ~ Represented by `~sinnfull.optim.base.OptimParams`.
#
# Prior space
# ~ contains instances of `FreeRV`, `Constant` and `TransformedRV`.
#
# Model space
# ~ contains instances of `Constant`, `Constant`, `FreeRV`, `TransformedRV` and `Deterministic`.
# ~ Represented by `~sinn.models.ModelParams`.
# :::
#
# [^num-RVs]: PyMC3 also defines the `ObservedRV` type, but by definition a prior should not contain observed variables.

# %% [markdown]
# Note that we have
#
# - **Random variables** (RVs) which are constructed with one of the PyMC3 distributions.
#   These form what we call the _prior space_.
# - **Bounded RVs**, which are associated to unbounded RVs via bijections.
#   These are automatically defined by PyMC3.
#   Since the unbounded variables are those with respect to which optimizers will differentiate,
#   we call the space of unbounded variables the _optimization space_.
# - RVs which are the result of **determistically transforming** other RVs.
#   These transformations are used to define parameters of the model which are derived from others.
#   We call the space of variables defined by the model the _model space_
#
# There are therefore two types of transformations:
#
# - _Bijective maps_ from _prior space_ to _optimization space_.
# - _Surjective maps_ from _prior space_ to _model space_.

# :::{admonition} More on transformed variables
# :class: dropdown
#
# By default, PyMC3 transforms all variables such that they have unbounded support on $\mathbb{R}$. For example, if a model includes `W = pm.Halfnormal('W', ...)`, than a private random variable `W_log__`, is created, using $\log$ to map $(0, \infty)$ to $(-\infty, \infty)$. This is generally desirable for numerical stability, but it is also possible to prevent the creation of a transformed variable by passing `transform=None` when creating the random variable.
#
# If a model parameter is specified in terms of a transformed random variable, this is best done by defining an `~pm.Deterministic` variable. For example, the code below defines $a$ as the row sums of a Gaussian matrix:
#
# ```python
# with Prior() as prior:
#     _a_mat = pm.Normal('_a_mat', mu=-1, sigma=1, shape(3, 3))
#     a      = pm.Deterministic(_a_mat.sum(axis=1))
# ```
#
# Note the use of a leading underscore in `_a_mat`: this indicates to `Prior` that this is an intermediate variable which is not part of the model. As such, it will not be included in the dictionary returned by `~Prior.random`.
#
# The disadvantage of `~pm.Deterministic` variables is that they don't provide a _log det jacobian_ and thus are not invertible. In general this should not be required, but if it is, it might be possible to specify the transformation using a `~pm.transforms.TransformedVar` instead. Since this is only lightly documented within PyMC3's developer documentation, we've compiled some WIP notes in the [developer docs](../../docs/Understanding_PyMC3_Transforms.ipynb). Note that we've never actually used a custom transformation in our models, and can't speak to their ultimate usefulness for this purpose.

#   It serializes the callable by storing its source code.
#   For this to work well, it should be as lean as possible; in particular,
#   PureFunction serializaton it doesn't work well if it inherits `BaseModel`.
#   User-facing code should not see this type.
# - `ObjectiveFunction` is a subclass of `BaseModel`. It wraps a
#   `PureFunctionObjective` object (stored as `func`), along with some
#   metadata. It provides redirects to the underlying function so that it can
#   be transparently used as a function.
#
# NOTE:
# Now that PureFunction allows registering deserializers for custom subtypes,
# it may not be necessary to have a separate ObjectiveFunction.

# %% [markdown] tags=["remove-cell"]
# PROBLEM: Serializing PureFunction includes the decorator(s). However,
#   we don't want to include the @ObjectiveFunction decorator (tags are
#   already stored, and could differ from those in the decorator?)
# SOLUTION/HACK: Create a new PureFunction type, which wraps the json_encoder
#   for PureFunction with another which removes lines starting with '@ObjectiveFunction'.
# AND YET: Now that tags are stored with `set` instead of `frozenset`, adding
#   tags should be harmless (unless they are dynamically removed).
#   Keeping the hack for now since it works and I don't care to work out
#   the magic done by ObjectiveFunction.\_\_new\_\_.

# (objective-functions)=
# ## Objective functions
#
# Mathematically, an objective function $l$ is function from the combined parameter ($θ$) and latent ($η$) spaces, to a scalar: $l(θ,η) \to \mathbb{R}$. In our framework, both $θ$ and $η$ can be retrieved from the model, so in code we have `l(model,...) -> float`.
#
# We consider two types of objective functions:
#
# - _Accumulated_ objective functions, which additionally take a time point $t$: `l(model, t)`.
#   These are meant to be evaluated at multiple time points, and their results summed (accumulated).
# - _Regularizers_, which take no extra arguments: `l(model)`.
#   For parameters, this is functionally equivalent to defining `Prior`.
#
# Since we don't currently implement regularizers, they are not discussed further.
#
# :::{note}
# Mathematically, one expects an objective function to be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), and this is required for the proper functionning of the framework. See _Serializability_ below.
# :::
#
# :::{note}
# The [`Optimizer`](sinnfull/optim/base) class names its objective function “*logp*”, which is borrowed from the name of the analogous function in [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/Probability_Distributions.html). In fact any scalar objective function is acceptable; it doesn't have to be a likelihood, or even a proper probability. However, if it does derive from a probability, it should correspond to the _log_ probability, such that it is compatible with an accumulated objective.
# :::
#
# :::{note}
# Objective functions are attached to the model being optimized, so their `self` arguments resolves to this model (note that the first argument *must* be named self). The second argument to the objective function must be a integer time index, corresponding to a time point on the model's *TimeAxis*.
# :::
#
# Beyond semantically identifying a function as being an objective, the `ObjectiveFunction` class adds the following functionality:
#
# - **Serializability** Since objective functions are [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), they can be serialized. This requires them to use only variables in their own scope (i.e., their arguments `self` and `k`) – in particular, they cannot use any external packages imported by the modules.
#   Exceptions are the *numpy* (`np`), *math* (`math`) and *theano_shim* (`shim`), which are specially provided by the deserializer.
# - **Basic arithmetic** Objective functions support basic arithmetic operations as *functions*.
#
# The support for arithmetic allows one to construct objectives from more primitive ones, e.g.
#
# ```python
# objective = γ*objective1 + (1-γ)*objective2
# ```
#
# would define a new function `objective` callable as `objective(model, k)`. This feature helps reduce the proliferation of objective definitions.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Semantic tags
#
# Although any string can be used as a tag, objective functions currently ascribed additional meaning to specific strings. This is used to inform users on the intended use of a function as well provide validation – for example, preventing both `forward` and `backward` tags from being used simultaneously.
#
# :::{admonition} Partly historical note
# :class: dropdown
#
# The list below describes the tags that were at some point defined, and which are still recognized by `ObjectiveFunction`. Since their expected usefulness has faded compared to previous iterations of the framework, their future is uncertain.
#
# - `forward`: Objective function corresponding to forward simulation. Appropriate for fitting parameters and latent variables; when fitting latents, the dependence on the simulation model makes this objective less reliable at the edges of the time trace.
#
# - `backward`: Objective function corresponding to backward simulation; not currently supported (`SGDOptimizer` would need a second, backward-integrated model)
#
# - `nodyn`: Purely pointwise objective functions; considers only whether the latents are consistent with observations. Not appropriate for fitting parameters. Fitting latents with a `nodyn` objective function leads to discontinuous latents which may not be consistent with the model, but avoids interplay between parameters and latents, which can lead to instabilities.
#
# - `global`: An objective function which doesn't take time points at all, but the model. Useful for specifying priors.
#
# - `regularizer`: A synonym for `global`.
#
# - `prior`: Functionally equivalent to `regularizer`, with the additional semantic meaning of “prior”.
#
# - `se`: “Squared-error”. Consistency with observations is computed by the squared difference between observations and predictions. This can be used as an ad-hoc substitute for an observation model.
#   This tag does not imply that parameter errors are computed by squared-error; it relates only to the dynamics (the latent error).
#
# - `l1`: $L^1$ loss. Consistency with observations is computed by the absolute difference between observations and predictions. This can be used as an ad-hoc substitute for an observation model.
#   This tag does not imply that parameter errors are computed with $L^1$; it relates only to the dynamics (the latent error).
#
# - `log L`: The objective corresponds to a log-likelihood, although it need not be normalized. In contrast to `se`, this is used to indicate that _all_ error terms stem from a likelihood, and therefore that the objective function as a whole may be interpreted as the unnormalized joint log probability $\log p(x | \Theta) + C$.
#
# These attributes can be specified as tags. Tags may be used by functions to decide how to use an objective function, or just to validate that it is of an expected type. They are also useful metadata for users, and we may in the future use them to automatically construct the API.
#
# The following sets of tags are mutually exclusive, for hopefully obvious reasons:
# - `forward`, `backward`, `nodyn`, `global`
# - `log L`, `se`

    Allows additional metadata to be attached in the form of tags, which
    functions like `~sinnfull.optim.SGDOptimizer` may use to determine
    how to use the function, or simply validate that it is of an expected type.

    Use as a decorator, or instantiate with a function argument.
    `ObjectiveFunction` is an abstract base class; during instantiation,
    a subclass is returned: either an `AccumulatedObjectiveFunction` or
    `Regularizer`, which have different expected signatures.
    The wrapped function must match the expected signature.

    Exposes a `submodel` attribute. This is used with composite model, to
    indicate which submodel should be passed as "model" argument to the
    objective function.
