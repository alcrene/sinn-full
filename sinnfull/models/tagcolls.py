    This function looks complicated, but it's just a series of `if` statements
    for the different formats objective selectors can take.
    Accepts a list of objective selectors, and returns the objective
    corresponding to each. The returned objectives can be combined with `sum`.
    
    Objectives selectors are either tuples or sets of tags (not lists),
    optionally including a dictionary of keyword arguments.
    Objectives for submodels are indicated by placing them in nested dictionaries.
    At any nesting level, multiple objectives can be defined by wrapping them
    in a list.
    
    Objectives are returned as a flat list, independent of nesting level.
